# Form Validation Web Page

This repository contains a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation for a form validation web page. The web page is designed to collect user information through a form and validate the input in real-time.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The web page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices.

- **Form Fields:** The form includes the following fields:
  - Full Name
  - Phone Number
  - Email Address
  - Message

- **Real-time Validation:** JavaScript is used to perform real-time validation on user input for each field. Error messages are displayed dynamically, guiding the user to correct any input errors.

- **Submit Button:** The form includes a "Submit" button that triggers a final validation before submission. If any errors are present, a consolidated error message is displayed, and the submission is blocked until corrections are made.

- **FontAwesome Integration:** FontAwesome icons are utilized for visual feedback on successful validation.

## File Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page, form elements, and FontAwesome integration.

- **style.css:** The CSS file providing styles for the web page, including the form layout, input styling, and responsive design.

- **script.js:** The JavaScript file responsible for real-time validation of form fields and the final submission validation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the form validation web page.
3. Customize the form fields, styles, or scripts according to your requirements.

## Dependencies
